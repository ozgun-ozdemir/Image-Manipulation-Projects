# Image Manipulation Projects
This repository contains a series of projects that demonstrate various image processing techniques and methods. Below are brief descriptions of each project and information on how they work.

## Projects
### Fourier Transform and Filtering
In this project, the Fourier transform of an image is computed, and low-pass and high-pass filters are applied. The effects of these filters, along with the spectra, are visualized.

### Color Transformations
In this project, specific colors in an image are replaced with other colors. The user can see how a white background can be transformed into blue, black, and red.

### Circle Drawing with Colors
This project involves creating a canvas and implementing an algorithm to draw circles in different colors. It showcases color transitions between inner and outer circles.

### Edge Detection and Filtering
This project employs various edge detection filters (Sobel, Laplace, Gaussian) to identify edges in an image. The results of different filters are compared.

### Image Histograms
In this project, histograms of images are computed and compared with the histograms of images after applying different filters.

### Image Concatenation
In this project, two images (a dog and a cat) are loaded and displayed. The images are resized to a uniform dimension and then concatenated both vertically and horizontally. The results are displayed in separate windows.
